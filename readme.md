Hey! This is our game!

Things to do:
# Assets:
- [ ] Textures for enemies, bullets, player
- [ ] Textures for lives, score, timer(probably custom font?)
- [ ] Textures for background

# Gameplay
- [ ] *Gameloop* 60FPS
- [ ] Player movement(<- (.player.) ->)
- [ ] Shooting (<space>)
- [ ] Enemies and their behaviour(dynamic spawn, dodging?)

# Gameplay vol.2
- [ ] Pause-menu (*continue, retry*) if gamearea is not selected === pause(when paused enemies do not spawn otherwise if frozen for a long time = gamebreak/freezes/crashes)
- [ ] Score handling == (1shot=1score)
- [ ] Collision with deadarea(behind the player screen)/player(-1 life)
